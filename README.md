# MiniProjects
A collection of mini-projects and implementations built using C and C++. The focus is on exploring low-level concepts, data structures, and algorithms to practice performance optimization and fundamental systems programming. Each project is self-contained and meant to help build a deeper understanding of systems programming and performance-oriented code.

## Projects
---
### TuringMachine
Description:
A basic Turing Machine simulator that supports custom transitions and tape behavior.

Concepts Used:
State machines, dynamic data structures, simulation logic.

Location:
/TuringMachine

# About This Repo

This repository is mainly for practice and experimentation.
Each project focuses on one or more of the following:

Low-level programming (C/C++)

Data structure implementation

Algorithms

Simulation or modeling

Memory-aware and performance-focused design

More projects will be added over time as learning continues.
