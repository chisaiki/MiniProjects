# MiniProjects
A collection of mini-projects and implementations built using C and C++. The focus is on exploring low-level concepts, data structures, and algorithms to practice performance optimization and fundamental systems programming. Each project is self-contained and meant to help build a deeper understanding of systems programming and performance-oriented code.
